# Frontend
 **`This application utilizes Jinja2 to render html pages. Please keep pages within the templates folder.`**
 ## setup
- No set up is necessary.
## functionality
- The html files are alittle JavaScript heavy.
- Most of the pages respond to the pages in a Async matter and so the pages react based on the data recieved from the response.

## future implementations
- using react native instead to build the frontend.
- auth0 logic in the frontend.
